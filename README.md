## Process
-  First I understood the data and then I applied filter on the data to find null values and anomalies.
-  I did data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values and made an Age group column from the Age column using the IF function.
-  Created a Pivot table to summarize the data and create charts and graphs to solve business problems.
-  At Last I merged all pivot charts into one dashboard and applied slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it in different ways to get results.
